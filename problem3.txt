1. During the assignment statement you are getting a reference, however the return type of that statement makes no promise that it will keep what you passed in const, thus we can't be sure that it will actually keep the Constness as we expected.


2. In number two you are saying x is a reference to a Constant X, however the return type is only X, which means that you cannot guarantee that what is returned will not modify the other parts of the class.
